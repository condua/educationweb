        "passage": "Environmental awareness refers to the understanding and knowledge that people have about the environment and the issues that threaten it. In recent decades, the increasing impact of climate change, deforestation, pollution, and loss of biodiversity has made environmental education more important than ever. Raising awareness is a crucial step in encouraging people to adopt more sustainable behaviors and to demand policies that protect the planet.\n\nOne significant aspect of environmental awareness is recognizing how human activities contribute to environmental degradation. From the overuse of fossil fuels to improper waste disposal, our actions directly affect the Earth’s ecosystems. For example, single-use plastics continue to pollute oceans and harm marine life, despite global efforts to reduce plastic consumption. Therefore, educating people about the consequences of their choices is a powerful tool for change.\n\nEnvironmental campaigns and social media also play a vital role in spreading awareness. By sharing facts, stories, and practical tips, these platforms help people understand the urgency of the problem and how they can make a difference. More importantly, they inspire collective action. When communities come together—whether to plant trees, clean rivers, or push for renewable energy—they create lasting impact.\n\nSchools and universities are increasingly incorporating environmental education into their curricula. Through interactive lessons and hands-on activities, students learn not just the science behind climate change, but also how to take action. In many places, young people are leading climate movements, proving that awareness can lead to real change when it is backed by education and activism.\n\nUltimately, promoting environmental awareness helps people make informed decisions that benefit both themselves and the planet. Whether it's reducing energy use, choosing eco-friendly products, or supporting green policies, individual efforts—when multiplied across millions—can contribute to a more sustainable future.",

        "passage": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries and reshaping the way we live and work. From smart assistants and facial recognition to medical diagnostics and self-driving cars, AI technologies are becoming deeply integrated into modern society. While many celebrate its potential to improve efficiency and accuracy, others worry about ethical issues, data privacy, and job displacement.\n\nAI’s impact is not felt equally across all sectors. In manufacturing, for example, automation powered by AI has led to the replacement of many routine jobs, while in healthcare, it supports professionals by analyzing complex data and assisting in diagnoses. [I] In education, AI tools are being used to personalize learning experiences, making lessons more engaging and tailored to individual students. [II] However, these benefits are not universal—regions with limited access to technology risk being left behind. [III] Addressing these inequalities is essential to ensure that AI promotes progress rather than deepening existing divides. [IV]\n\nGovernments and companies are now discussing ways to regulate AI and manage its growth responsibly. Debates center around how to ensure transparency in AI decisions and how to prevent biases from being embedded in algorithms. At the same time, experts emphasize the need to include diverse voices in AI development—so that the technology reflects a broader range of values and experiences.\n\nPublic awareness is also growing. People are beginning to question how AI affects their daily lives—from the content they see online to the way their data is collected and used. Youth activists, researchers, and civil rights organizations are calling for more ethical guidelines in AI deployment and more accountability from tech giants.\n\nDespite uncertainties, AI holds great promise. If developed and governed responsibly, it can revolutionize fields from agriculture to environmental monitoring. But realizing this promise depends on global cooperation, inclusive development, and a shared commitment to human-centered technology.",
